        launched numerous user facing and server side features using React
        Native, added an authentication/authorization system to validate user
        actions and reduce error rates, and designed an ad-creation flow to
        improve usability. My mentor at Facebook had a profound impact on me,
        teaching me that while it's important to be a rockstar engineer from a
        technical perspective, it's even more important to empower those around
        me.

        This was my first time professionally working and building something
        people actually used. I implemented an Emergency Room vitals dashboard
        used to quickly assess a patient's condition. Additionally, I redesigned
        and rewrote an existing data visualization library, reducing rendering
        latency by 50% and promoted its usage across all Epic applications. It
        was especially motivating that my work impacted health care providers
        and potentially saved patient lives.
